### December waste moved

Users wanted to see the December waste balance question on this page while they were filling in the details.

We have amended the design to show this detail, it will only appear in January.  

We put the December waste question first to help with validation, so we immediately know which balance they are using and can validate on that.

### Accreditation page redesign - site added

‘Multiple site’ users were worried that the accreditation shown might be showing site balances added together​. We have redesigned to show sites per accreditation​.



An access needs user wanted the page to have a description for ease of understanding​, We added a description to page, we don't tend to add these until later rounds, so we don't steer the users when asking if they understand the pages​.


'PRNs ready to send' messaging was deemed not needed​ so we took it out.  


We also changed the wording to 'usable waste balance' to match new accreditation details on other pages.

### Accreditation details - limits and validation errors etc

We added the accreditation limits so we can validate and show errors for going over a limit. We have used the terminology ‘Usable waste balance’ to signify the balance they can raise a PRN against and ‘Excess waste balance’ to show the waste they have recorded over their current accreditation limit. This would also be reflected in the regulator site, to show they have exceeded their limit.  

The system would allow them to record waste, but tell them they have exceeded their limit and need to upgrade their accreditation to use this excess waste balance to create a PRN.  

The system will not allow them to create a PRN against their excess waste balance, only the usable waste balance, they would get validation errors to explain what is happening.

### What have you done with the waste - changed from recycling - failed experiment!

We tried to use the terminology ‘recycling’ to match the use in the new legislation, the users were unanimous in telling us that they did not use that terminology and preferred ‘reprocessing’. We have changed it back but would warrant further exploration as it is used in the legislation.

### Site name in caption

We have added the site name into the caption as the users were concerned that they would not remember what site they had selected.
