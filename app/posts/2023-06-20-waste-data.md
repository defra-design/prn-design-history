This post is about the first iteration of waste data submission.


## Co-design session

We ran a co-design session with the product team to better understand the requirements and created a basic flow on a mural board. The data required for creating a waste record is changing over year 1 and 2.

## Creating the initial design

We created a prototype using the gov.uk prototype kit collaboratively, these are some of the key design decisions we made.

### Language

We have decided to use language like ‘Create a waste record’ to describe what they are doing – this waste record can then be submitted as part of their quarterly or monthly returns (Sprint 4).  

The users will then use the balance created from this waste record to ‘Raise a PRN’ against.  
We are going to analyse the language used by the participants in the UR sessions and observe how they interact with the content to assess if this language works.  

### File upload

One of the assumptions we want to test in research is whether our users will find it useful being able to ‘upload a file’ instead of entering all the information manually.

We took the file upload journey directly from RPD and did some minor content changes to make it appropriate for our journey.

### Enter a source name


In year 1 there is no requirement for the users to enter information about the source of the waste. We wanted to add this into the initial design for research to understand whether our users have this information currently and get them ready for the future versions of the product.

### Waste records

We created a view to allow users to see all waste records that have been created and edit them using a check your answers style page.

We took the columns from the table view in NPWD and want to see in the research if users find this information valuable and iterate it on it.

## Research plan


The initial design for ‘Record your waste’ will be through its first round of user research in sprint 5.
