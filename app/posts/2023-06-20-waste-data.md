This post is about the first iteration of waste data submission.


## Co-design session

 We ran a co-design session with product and business people to better understand the requirements and created a basic flow on a mural board.

## Creating the initial design

 We created a prototype using the govuk prototype kit collaboratively, these are some of the key design decisions we made.


### File upload

one of the assumptions we want to find out about in research is Whether our users will find it useful being able to 'upload a file' instead of enter all the information manually.

we took the file upload journey directly from RPD and did some minor content changes

### Enter a source name


In year 1 there is no requirements for the users to enter information about the source of the waste. we wanted to add this into the initial design for research to understand Whether or not our users have this information currently and get them ready for the future of the product.

### Waste records

Created a view to allow users to see all waste records created and edit them using a check your answers style page.

We took the content for the table from NPWD and want to see via research Whether users find this information valuable and iterate it.

## Research plan

The initial design for 'Record your waste' will be through its first round of user research in sprint 5.
