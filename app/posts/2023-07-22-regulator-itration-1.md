This post is about first iteration based on the first round of research on Regulator prototype




### Organisation details

Users need to be able to differentiate between Registered (Companies House) address, Business/head office address (if different to Registered) and site address(es) - Changed to Registered office address

Users would like a contact for the registered address, but we need to investigate how to get this on the registration journey when that is designed.

### User details

Users were confused by some new terminology around user types and roles that don't align to NPWD terminology
Changed to Authorised


Regulators would expect to see role / job description/ relationship between delegated users and the organisation (particularly applied to consultants) - we don’t collect this, needs changes to enrolment

Job titles and phone numbers would be useful for all users

we don’t collect this, needs changes to enrolment

Users had an expectation of being able to add / remove / amend users and user details - need to see what we want to do here - is it possible

### Changed revoke to cancel

Didn’t understand revoke, they know it as ‘cancelling’
Changed revoke to cancel everywhere

Success page - changed from revoke to cancel

On both cancel and suspend, removed the line about emails being sent

Reactivating after revoking has been removed as it is not how the process works

### Still  to do

 Make sure we have all statuses for accreditation applications


current accreditation balance and all transactions (waste records and PRNs) on this overview screen
