This post is about third iteration based on the fourth round of research on creating PRN and record your waste from sprint 6

### Accreditation page

We tested with a proxy user with access needs, they suggested that they would expect content to explain what the page is, we have since added a description to the page below the H1.  

As there are numerous actions available on the next page, we feel that there is a need for some content on the accreditation page to explain why they should choose an accreditation and what this will allow them to do next.   

This type of descriptive content is left out at the beginning of the design process as we like to encourage the users tell us what they think the page is for based on the interactions on the page.  

### Actions page

Most users mentioned that we weren’t telling them when their next return is due. We have added a line of content in the Submit your returns box to tell them the date of their next return.

### Record waste

Most users who don’t supply on waste do not understand the terminology. We've focused the call to action on this page to only be generically about recording waste and then put a question about received vs supplied on the next page. This keeps supplied on in the journey, but makes it less prominent.

Users wanted to be able to filter waste records by monthly/quarterly and delete waste records if they made a mistake. We added filters in the same style as PRN to the waste records screens.

When looking at adding multiple waste records, most users didn’t understand what a CSV file was, so we changed the terminology changed CSV to spreadsheet.

Multiple users initially confused this screen with the registered/accredited site at which the waste was received.

At first we changed to ‘Where did the waste come from’ but then later deleted it as it was decided at a product level that this page was not needed.

### Create PRNs



In this, and previous rounds of UR, users have been confused by the terminology 'Raised' and 'issued' PRNs, so to mimic inbox mental models, we've changed the language to ‘create’, ‘draft’ and ‘send’.


To clarify language further based on UR we changed the ‘Reference’ label to say ‘PRN number’.

We identified in UR a need to cancel PRNs from the details page, so we added call to actions to cancel and send to the details page.

A need to cancel PRNs from the details page.

Added cancel and send to details page.

### Quarterly returns
We realised while looking at the comments in the UR that there was a possibility that the users might not be realising where the quarterly return gets sent to.  

Users did not say this directly, however we felt as it is a mandated return, mentioning who it is going to was needed.  

We added a line about the return being sent to the Environment Agency on the confirmation page. This would be dynamic based on the agency.
