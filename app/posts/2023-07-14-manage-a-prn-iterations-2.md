Accreditation page -

Proxy user would like content to explain what the page is.
Added a description to the page


Actions page -

User mentioned that no time scale on quarterly returns are due.

Added when next return is due



Record waste -

Users that do not supply on do not understand the terminology

Changed CTA to Record waste and put a question about received vs supplied on on the next page


Users want to be able to filter Monthly/quarterly

Added in filters



Users want to be able to delete waste records

Added in delete


Didn’t understand CSV so
Changed CSV to spreadsheet


Multiple users initially confused this screen with the registered/accredited site at which the waste was received

Changed to ‘Where did the waste come from’ but then deleted as it is not needed


PRNs -



Changed language to Create, draft and send

Changed reference label to ‘PRN number’


A need to cancel PRNs from the details page.

Added cancel and send to details page





Quarterly returns -

Users might not be realising where it gets sent to, based on reading into the comments in UR

Added EA on the confirmation page







Regulator -

Users need to be able to differentiate between Registered (Companies House) address, Business/head office address (if different to Registered) and site address(es) - Changed to Registered office address

Users would like a contact for the registered address, but we need to investigate how to get this on the registration journey when that is designed.




Some users wanted a clearer way to differentiate between Producers, Reprocessors, Exporters

Added if they are a reprocessor etc

Users were confused by some new terminology around user types and roles that don't align to NPWD terminology
Changed to Authorised



Regulators would expect to see role / job description/ relationship between delegated users and the organisation (particularly applied to consultants) - we don’t collect this, needs changes to enrolment



Job titles and phone numbers would be useful for all users

we don’t collect this, needs changes to enrolment

Users had an expectation of being able to add / remove / amend users and user details - need to see what we want to do here - is it possible




Filters added to waste record and PRN regulator view

Didn’t understand revoke, they know it as ‘cancelling’
Changed revoke to cancel everywhere

Success page - changed from revoke to cancel

On both cancel and suspend, removed the line about emails being sent



Reactivating after revoking has been removed as it is not how the process works


Still to do - Make sure we have all statuses for accreditation applications


Still to do - current accreditation balance and all transactions (waste records and PRNs) on this overview screen
