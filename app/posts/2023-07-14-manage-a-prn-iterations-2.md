This post is about third iteration based on the fourth round of research on creating PRN and record your waste from sprint 6

### Accreditation page

we tested with a proxy user with access needs which  would expect the content to explain what the page is, we have since added a description to the page below the H1.


### Actions page

Most user mentioned that no time scale on quarterly returns are due, we have added when next return is due

### Record waste

Most users that do not supply on waste do not understand the terminology. we've changed the call to action on this page to make it less prominent and put a question put a question about received vs supplied on on the next page

Users wanted to be able to filter waste records by monthly/quarterly and delete waste records if they made a mistake. we added filters the same as PRN to the waste records screens.

Most users didn’t understand what a CSV file was so we changed the terminology changed CSV to spreadsheet.

Multiple users initially confused this screen with the registered/accredited site at which the waste was received

Changed to ‘Where did the waste come from’ but then deleted as it is not needed.




### Create PRNs -



From previous roounds and this round lots of users have been confused by the terminology 'Rasied' and 'issued' PRNs we've changed language to Create, draft and send.

changed reference label to ‘PRN number’

A need to cancel PRNs from the details page.

Added cancel and send to details page

### Quarterly returns -

Users might not be realising where it gets sent to, based on reading into the comments in UR, Added  Environment Agency on the confirmation page.
