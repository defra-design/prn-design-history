This post is about the second iteration of raising, issuing, and managing a PRN based on research in sprint 4.


### Changes to 'Manage your PRN' landing page

Continuing from our previous iteration, users were still confused by where the issued PRNs are and were clicking ‘Raised PRNs’ instead.  
We made some significant changes to this screen, including moving the raised PRNs into a table on the landing page, we also added a line of content to describe what is in the table and what actions are possible.  
We also renamed ‘Raised PRNs’ to ‘Draft PRNs’ to match language used by our users. This is a departure from the language used on NPWD and will need further testing. We feel this will resonate better with new users who haven’t used NPWD, as draft is a widely recognised term, whereas ‘raised’ can be ambiguous alongside ‘issued’.

### Confusion around which accreditation

Some users were confused by which accreditation they were recording waste against. To address this, we changed the caption above the H1 from the task you are doing to the accreditation for example, ‘Record your waste’ is now ‘Paper/board’.

### File upload

Users were expressing a clear user need to be able to add multiple waste records at once, but they didn’t realise that the file upload option was specifically there for them to be able to do that. Some of them were unsure what the file upload was for and thought it was so they could upload pictures as evidence.  
We added some extra content to express what the file upload is for. This was so they can see the benefit and that it might meet their user need.

### Experimental version

We heard a lot of feedback from users about the journeys being too ‘long-winded’. Often mentioning the GDS approach of ‘one thing per page’. They felt that in comparison to the ‘all on one page’ approach on NPWD, this would take them longer to fill in.  
In response, we have created an experimental version of the journeys, which we will test next sprint. This version uses logical, thematic groupings of data items which significantly reduce the number of pages in the journeys.
