This post is about the second iteration of raising, issuing, and managing a PRN based on research from sprint 4.


### Changes to 'manage your PRN' landing page


Continuing from our previous iteration users were still confused by the 'Raised PRNs' tables, we made significant change to this screen to more reflect the user workflow

### Confusion around which accreditation

Some users were confused by which accreditation they were recording waste against. we changed the caption above the h1 from the task you are doing to the accreditation for example, 'Record your waste' is now 'Paper/board'.

### File upload

### Experimental version

Lots of feedback form users around the journeys being too 'long-winded' so suspect this is because we are using the GDS approach of 'one thing per page'. we have created a Experimental verison of the journeys to test next sprint using logical groupings of data items which significantly reduce the pages in the journeys.
