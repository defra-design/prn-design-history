This post is about the first iteration of raising, issuing, and managing a PRN based on research from sprint 3.

The main iterations we made were:


- removed all optional questions from raising a PRN

- changed the order of the manage your PRN/Create a waste record boxes

- changed order of pages and put accreditations first – added previous years accreditations too  

- changed the link content on the raised PRN box so it is clearer that is where the raised ones are

- changed the issued PRN boxes to be a table with filters

- changed the skip link to be next to the continue button  



###  Removed all of the optional questions

We removed all the optional questions from the PRN flow because most of the participants said they either wouldn’t find them useful or didn’t feel comfortable filling them out.

###  Changed the order of raise a PRN/waste record boxes and changed order of landing pages

We changed the order of the accreditation screen and task screen based on comments from 3 participants about being unsure which accreditation they were choosing on the original landing page.
We also added previous accreditations as they mentioned they would like to be able to view these.

2 participants mentioned the order of the ‘task’ page wasn’t in the order you actually do things, ‘record your waste’ would be first.

###  Changed the link content and description on the raised PRN box so it is clearer that is where the raised ones are

We amended the link text and description as the users commented that they couldn’t understand where the Raised PRNs had gone when it said ‘Issue PRNs’ as the action-led link.  
We have changed it to read the opposite way, where the raised PRNs is the focus with the issuing action mentioned in the description – this might require further iteration.


###  Changed the issued PRN boxes to be a table with filters

Most of the participants didn’t find the pre-filtered tables clear or didn’t understand where to amend.  
We also felt that having a fourth layer underneath the landing pages was difficult and adding to the confusion they were having when navigating.  

We changed the design to show all the Issued PRNs in a table which can be filtered by users. This gives the users flexibility to manipulate the data.  

We are interested to see if they ask for further features including ordering the columns and a search.

###  Changed the skip link to be next to the continue button and removed optional questions from raising a prn

Most of the participants didn’t notice the skip link unless prompted so we have moved it next to the main call to action.
