This post is about the first iteration of raising, issuing and managing a PRN based on research from sprint 3.

In this post we'll be doing into details about the main iteration we created based on research from the previous sprint, the main iteration we made were:


- Changed the order of raise a PRN/waste records boxes
- Changed order of pages and put accreditations years first â€“ added previous years
- Changed the link content on the raised PRN box so it is clearer that is where the raised ones are
- Changed the issued PRN boxes to be a table with filters
- Changed the skip link to be next to the continue button and removed optional questions from raising a prn


###  Changed the order of raise a PRN/waste records boxes and changed order of landing pages


we changed the order of the accreditation screen and task screen based on comments from 3 participants about being unsure which accreditation they were choosing on the original landing page.

2 participants mentioned the order of the 'task' page wasnt the order you actually do things, 'record your waste' would be first.

###  Changed the link content on the raised PRN box so it is clearer that is where the raised ones are


###  Changed the issued PRN boxes to be a table with filters

most of the participants didnt find the pre fitlered tables clear or didnt understand where to actions like amend. we also felt like having a forth layer underneath the landing pages was difficult and confusing to navigiaton.

we moved to showing all the Issued PRN in a table which can be filtered by users.

###  Changed the skip link to be next to the continue button and removed optional questions from raising a prn

most of the participants didnt notice the skip link unless prompted so we have moved it next to the main call to action.

we also removed all the optional questions from the PRN flow because most of the participants said they either wouldnt find them useful or didnt feel comfortable filling them out.
