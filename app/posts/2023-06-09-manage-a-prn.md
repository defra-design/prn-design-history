This post is about the first iteration of raising, issuing and managing a PRN designed by Helen and Joe

### Figma work

Inital flow and design work were done in [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Oph288IL3Aan2xDUEWpAAN/Raise-and-issue-PRNs?type=design&node-id=2%3A2&t=n6vsOWoXhtUlOi6m-1), we have since moved all this work to prototype kit.

### Using components from design system backlog


We are using [Dave House card patterns](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/113#issuecomment-390905761) from design system backlog

We plan to feedback any research we get into the card pattern into the alphagov backlog

### Adding questions which are optional


Normally we would avoid asking questions which are optional or clearly mark them but we want to find out through research a few different things:

1. Whether users sell their PRNs before raising them
2. Whether users find being able to add their own reference and note useful

### Manage your PRNs

### Research plan

The initial design for 'raising, issuing and managing PRN' will be through its first round of user research in sprint 4.
