This post is about the first iteration of raising, issuing, and managing a PRN journey mapping and content design by Helen Dickerson, mapping and figma design by Joe Horton and prototype work by Mark Wright.

### Figma work

Initial flow and design work were done in [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Oph288IL3Aan2xDUEWpAAN/Raise-and-issue-PRNs?type=design&node-id=2%3A2&t=n6vsOWoXhtUlOi6m-1), we have since moved all this work to prototype kit.

### Using components from design system backlog


We are using [Dave House card patterns](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/113#issuecomment-390905761) from design system backlog.

We plan to feedback any research we get into the card pattern into the alphagov backlog.

### Adding questions which are optional


Normally we would avoid asking questions which are optional or clearly mark them but we want to find out through research a few different things:

-  whether users sell their PRNs before raising them

-  whether users find adding details about the sale useful

-  whether users find being able to add their own reference and note useful

This information will help support new reporting requirements in the new legislation and provide insight into how we can improve on NPWD, their existing system.

### Manage your PRNs

We have a landing page which aims to provide a way for reprocessors and exporters to manage their PRNs, they can see which PRNs have been raised and need issuing. They can also track the PRN as it gets approved by the compliance scheme or producer.  
They should be able to use this page and immediately see what needs to be done next and what statuses the PRNs have.  
The boxes click through to filtered tables, from which they are able to apply various actions, including viewing, editing, issuing, deleting and cancelling.

### Research plan

The initial design for 'raising, issuing and managing PRN' will be through its first round of user research in sprint 4.
